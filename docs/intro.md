# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook. This book bridges the gap between AI in digital spaces and real-world physical robots. Here, you will learn how to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots share our physical form and can learn from interacting in human environments. They represent a transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** operating in the physical world.

## What You'll Learn

- Principles of **Physical AI** and embodied intelligence  
- **ROS 2** for robot control  
- Robot simulation with **Gazebo** and **Unity**  
- AI development with **NVIDIA Isaac Platform**  
- Humanoid robot design for **natural interactions**  
- Integration of **GPT models** for conversational robotics
